        </h3>
        <p>
          These terms of service ("TOS") is an agreement between you and Telos Corporation that apply to your access to and use of this website and the Telos products, materials, software, information, tools, services, updates, enhancements and new features that Telos makes available to you via this website (collectively the "Services").

        </h3>
        <p>
          3.1 Information Use and Disclosure by Telos. Your privacy is important to Telos. As part of the Services, Telos may automatically upload, track and record information about your devices, your use of the Services and Services performance. Please read the Telos Privacy Statement as it describes the types of data Telos collects from you and your devices (“Data”) and how we use and disclose that Data. The privacy statement also describes how Telos uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings or feedback submitted by you to Telos via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, and videos that you upload, store or share through the Services ("Your Content"). By using the Services or agreeing to these TOS, you consent to Telos’s collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Telos Privacy Statement.
          3.2 Acknowledgment and Consent by You.
          (a) If you use your work email account to open your account for this website, you agree that Telos may share your usage Data for any training content and assessments accessed through the Services with your employer and you acknowledge that by agreeing to share this Data, you are allowing your employer to view reports on your usage Data.
          (b) If you are a Telos employee and you use your telos.io email account to open your account for this website, you agree that Telos may share your personal information and usage Data for any training content and assessments accessed through the Services with your management at Telos and you acknowledge that by agreeing to share this Data, you are allowing your management at Telos to view reports on your usage Data.
          3.3 Data Transfer Notice. Your Data and Your Content (including personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland) may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Telos or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. You appoint Telos to perform any such transfer of your Data to any such country and to store and process your Data in order to provide the Services. Telos abides by the EU Safe Harbor and the Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

        <h3>
          Section 4: Website Account, Notifications and Service Availability
        </h3>
        <p>
          4.1 Website Account. You must have an account for this website to access and use the Services. You may have only one (1) account for this website at a time. You agree (a) not to provide any false, inaccurate or misleading information when registering for your account, and (b) to maintain and update your account information so it remains current and accurate. You are required to sign in with your website account each time you access the Services. You may not transfer to any third party, either temporarily or permanently, any rights to access or use the Services or your account. You may not use anyone else's account to access the Services. You are solely responsible for: (a) keeping your password and account confidential, and (b) any and all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify Telos of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Telos will not be liable for any loss that you incur if someone else uses your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Telos or another party if someone else uses your account.
          4.2 Account Use. You must use your account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your account and Services active. If you don’t sign in during this time, we may assume your account is inactive and we may close it for you. Telos may permanently delete your Data, Your Content and usage reports from its servers if (a) you no longer have an active account for this website, or (b) the Services are canceled, or (c) your access to the Services is terminated and Telos does not have any duty to provide you with Your Content, Data, or usage reports. Telos will not be liable for any loss or damage you may incur from the deletion of any of Your Content, Data or usage reports. If Telos reasonably suspects that your account is being used by a third party (for example, because of an account compromise), Telos may suspend or terminate your account.
          4.3 Closing Your Account.
          (a). You can close your account at any time. To close your account, please follow the instructions at the “Support” hyperlink located at the bottom of any webpage that is part of this website.
          (b). If your access to the Services is terminated, the Services are canceled or your account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Services stops immediately and your license to use the software and materials related to the Services ends. Second, we may delete Your Content and the Data associated with your account or may otherwise disassociate it from you and your account (unless we are required by law to keep it). Third, you will lose access to the tools and content you’ve acquired.
          4.4 Service Notifications. When there’s something important to tell you about a Service, we’ll send you notifications to the email associated with your website account.
          4.5 Service Availability. Some or all the Services (a) may be unavailable from time to time, (b) may be offered for a limited period of time, or (c) may vary depending on your region or device. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Telos is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer because the Services were not available. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve your Data that you’ve stored.
          4.6 Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment.
          4.7 Support. For customer support for the Services, follow the instructions at the “Support” hyperlink located at the bottom of any webpage that is part of this website.

        <h3>
          Section 5: Your Content
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many of our Services allow you to store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains Your Content and you are responsible for it.
          When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, transmit, and display Your Content without compensating you. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these TOS, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use, and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others. Telos cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using the Services.
          To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Telos products and services, you grant to Telos a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use, make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, publicly display, and distribute Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are covered in detail in the Telos Privacy Statement.

          If you violate these TOS or if Telos suspects fraud or unauthorized or improper use of the Services, we may stop providing Services to you or we may close your website account. We may also block delivery of a communication (like email or instant message) to or from the Services to enforce these TOS or we may remove or refuse to publish your Content for any reason. When investigating alleged violations of these TOS, Telos reserves the right to review Your Content to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so.
          Telos reserves the right to disclose any information as Telos deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request in Telos's sole discretion.

          Any content that Telos makes available as part of the Services is the copyrighted work of Telos or its suppliers and is licensed, not sold.

        <h3>
          Section 15: Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if you live in the United States.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. "We," "our," and "us" includes Telos and Telos’s affiliates.
          15.1 Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, your account for this website, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.
          15.2 Mail a Notice of Dispute First. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Telos, LLC, ATTN: P.O. Box 23170 Saint Louis, MO 63156. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.
          15.3 Small Claims Court Option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A. if you meet the court’s requirements.
          15.4 Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Telos. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
          15.5 Arbitration Fees and Payments.
          (a) Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
          (b) Disputes Involving More than $75,000. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
          15.6 Conflict with AAA Rules. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.
          15.7 Must File Within One Year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.1 within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it's permanently barred.
          15.8 Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.2. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.
          15.9 Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of section 15 still applies

          USE AND DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES
        </h3>
        <p>
          Among other things, we and the educational institutions and other leading global members that provide courses through Telos (the "Members") may use the information about you collected through the Site (including your Personal Information) in connection with the following. In cases where we share or disclose your Personal Information: (1) the third party recipients are required to handle the Personal Information in a confidential manner and to maintain adequate security to protect the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction; and (2) we will only disclose and share the Personal Information that is required by the third party to fulfill the purpose stated at the time of collection.
          To enable the Members to provide, administer, and improve the courses.
          To help us and the Members improve Telos offerings, both individually (e.g., by course staff when working with a student) and in aggregate, and to individualize the experience and to evaluate the access and use of the Site and the impact of Telos on the worldwide educational community.
          For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in the areas of cognitive science and education.
          For the purpose for which you specifically provided the information, for example, to respond to a specific inquiry or provide you with access to the specific course content and/or services you select.
          To track both individual and aggregate attendance, progress and completion of an online course, and to analyze statistics on student performance and how students learn.
          To monitor and detect violations of the Honor Code, the Terms of Service, as well as other misuses and potential misuses of the Site.

          To send you updates about online courses offered by Telos or other events, to send you communications about products or services of Telos, Telos affiliates, or selected business partners that may be of interest to you, or to send you email messages about Site maintenance or updates.
          To archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you.
          To maintain and improve the functioning and security of the Site and our software, systems, and network.

          To authenticate your identity when you register for a paid certificate.
          To process refunds, as applicable.
          We will share information we collect with the Members, and we and the Members may share this information (including Personal Information) with third parties as follows:
          With service providers or contractors that perform certain functions on our or the Members' behalf, including processing information that you provide to us on the Site, processing purchases via third party providers, and other transactions through the Site, operating the Site or portions of it, providing or administering courses, or in connection with other aspects of Telos or Member services.
          With other visitors to the Site, to the extent that you submit comments, coursework, or other information or content (collectively, "Postings") to a portion of the Site designed for public communications; and with other members of an Telos class of which you are a member, to the extent you submit Postings to a portion of the Site designed for viewing by those class members.

          For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in the areas of cognitive science and education. However, we will only share Personal Information about you for this purpose to the extent doing so complies with applicable law and is limited to the Personal Information required to fulfill the purposes stated at the time of collection.
          To provide opportunities for you to communicate with other users who may have similar interests or educational goals. For instance, we may recommend specific study partners or connect potential student mentees and mentors.

          To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to investigate, or prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or security or technical issues, or to enforce our Terms of Service, our Honor Code, or this Privacy Policy; as otherwise may be required by applicable law; or to protect our rights, property, or safety or those of others.
          With affiliates of Telos or the Members, or with successors in the event of a merger, acquisition or reorganization, for their use consistent with this Privacy Policy.
          As otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
          For integration with third party services. For example, videos and other content may be hosted on YouTube and other websites not controlled by Telos.
          In addition, we may share aggregated information that does not personally identify you with the public and with third parties, including but not limited to researchers and business partners.

          USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.
